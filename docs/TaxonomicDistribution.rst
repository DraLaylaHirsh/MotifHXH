Eukaryotic Taxonomic Distribution
=================================


.. image:: /images/taxonomic.png

With the results of Hmmer, we divided the analisis in 3, Eukaryot 808 sequences, Virus 178 sequences and Bacteria 85 sequences, in this section we work on the 808 Eukaryotic sequences.

We can observe the domains architectures for this sequences, and we will see 3 "big" clusters

This SEED gave us diferent architecture domains and we analized each of them by getting all the complete sequences of the cluster, align them and eliminate the redundacy considering a 75% .
The results are the following:

Cluster 379
-----------
After aligning and cleaning the redundancy we had 16 complete sequences that were trimmed
