How we got the sequences
========================
We visit PFAM entry for Phage tail repeat like `here <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/PF12789/entry_alignments/?type=seed/>`_
From this page we obtain the SEED and curate it, obtaining `this new SEED <https://github.com/DraLaylaHirsh/MotifHXH/blob/0a919053e5ccf16bca6110c5f9ed3a03f696efd4/docs/best85817344-35C1.afa/>`_
